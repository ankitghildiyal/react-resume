                                <p>Event Platform, as the name suggests was a platform to provide carrier events across Home Depot. The data was used to track shipment status within Home Depot.

                                    <li>Architected carrier integration solution with carriers like Fedex, UPS, Purolator so we get package delivery statuses.</li>
                                    <li>Peer code reviewer and gate keeper for merging code for release.</li>
